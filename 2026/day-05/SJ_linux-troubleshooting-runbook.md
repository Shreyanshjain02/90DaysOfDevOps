## Task
You will pick a running process/service on your system and:

To pick a running service used:-

systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

**OR**

ps aux

**OR**

top # to get top cpu or memory consuming process or service

- Capture a quick health snapshot (CPU, memory, disk, network)



- Trace logs for that service

- Write a **mini runbook** describing what you did and what you’d do next if things were worse

This turns yesterday’s practice into a repeatable troubleshooting routine.

### What’s a runbook?
A **runbook** is a short, repeatable checklist you follow during an incident: the exact commands you run, what you observed, and the next actions if the issue persists. Keep it concise so you can reuse it under pressure.
Being SRE, Runbook for linux system should follow below commands.
**cat /proc/cpuinfo**

**uptime** (gives number of users active in last 1,5,15min, which gives idea of CPU cores being used by users vs system)
**Top** (Gives me idea of top CPU and mem consuming process or service)
**pidstate**

## Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your runbook:

- Run and record output for **at least 8 commands** (save snippets in your runbook)  
  - **Environment basics (2):** `uname -a`, `lsb_release -a` (or `cat /etc/os-release`)  
  - **Filesystem sanity (2):** create a throwaway folder and file, e.g., `mkdir /tmp/runbook-demo`, `cp /etc/hosts /tmp/runbook-demo/hosts-copy && ls -l /tmp/runbook-demo`  
  - **CPU / Memory (2):** `top`/`htop`/`ps -o pid,pcpu,pmem,comm -p <pid>`, `free -h`, `vm_stat` (mac)  
  - **Disk / IO (2):** `df -h`, `du -sh /var/log`, `iostat`/`vmstat`/`dstat`  
  - **Network (2):** `ss -tulpn`/`netstat -tulpn`, `curl -I <service-endpoint>`/`ping`  
  - **Logs (2):** `journalctl -u <service> -n 50`, `tail -n 50 /var/log/<file>.log`
- Choose **one target service/process** (e.g., `ssh`, `cron`, `docker`, your web app) and stick to it for the drill.
- For each command, add a 1–2 line note on what you observed (e.g., “CPU spikes to 80% when restarting”, “No recent errors in last 50 lines”).
- End with a **“If this worsens”** section listing 3 next steps you would take (ex: restart strategy, increase log verbosity, collect `strace`).
- Keep it concise and actionable (aim for ~1 page).

Suggested structure for `linux-troubleshooting-runbook.md`:
- Target service / process
- Snapshot: CPU & Memory
- Snapshot: Disk & IO
- Snapshot: Network
- Logs reviewed
- Quick findings
- If this worsens (next steps)

## Resources
You may refer to:

- Notes from Day 02–04
- Linux `man` pages (`top`, `ps`, `df`, `journalctl`, `ss/netstat`)
- Your class notes

Avoid generic copy/paste. Use outputs from **your** machine.

## Why This Matters for DevOps
Incidents rarely come with perfect clues. A fast, repeatable checklist saves minutes when services misbehave.

This drill builds:
- Habit of capturing evidence before acting
- Confidence reading resource signals (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Log-first mindset before restarts or escalations

These habits reduce downtime and prevent guesswork in production.
